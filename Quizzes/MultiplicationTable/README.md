# Multiplication Table

Write a program that takes an integer `n` as input and prints the multiplication table from 1 to `n`.

## Input
- A single integer `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`.

## Output
- The output should consist of `n` lines, where each line `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) contains the multiplication results of `i` from 1 to `n`, separated by spaces.


## Explanation
For the input `3`, the output is the multiplication table up to `3`, where:
- The first line is the multiplication of `1`: 1, 2, 3
- The second line is the multiplication of `2`: 2, 4, 6
- The third line is the multiplication of `3`: 3, 6, 9
